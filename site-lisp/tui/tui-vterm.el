;;; Commentary:

;; To use TUI with VTerm, eval the following code:

;;  (setq tui-terminal-function #'tui-vterm-exec)

;;; Code:

(require 'vterm nil t)

(define-derived-mode tui-vterm-mode vterm-mode "VTerm[TUI]")

;;;###autoload
(defun tui-vterm-exec (name command callback)
  (let* ((dir default-directory)
	 (vterm-shell (format "sh -c %s" (shell-quote-argument command)))
	 (vterm-buffer-name (concat "*" name "*"))
	 (vterm-kill-buffer-on-exit nil)
	 (vterm-mode-hook nil))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create vterm-buffer-name)
      (setq default-directory dir)
      (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
	(erase-buffer))
      (pop-to-buffer (current-buffer)
		     '((display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
		       (pop-up-frame-parameters
			(auto-hide-function . delete-frame))))
