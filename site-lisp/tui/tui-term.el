;;; Commentary:

;; To use Term with TUI, eval the following code:

;;   (setq tui-terminal-function #'tui-term-exec)

;;; Code:


(require 'term)

(define-derived-mode tui-term-mode term-mode "Term[TUI]")

;;;###autoload
(defun tui-term-exec (name command callback)
  (let ((dir default-directory))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create (concat "*" name "*"))
      (setq default-directory dir)
      (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
	(erase-buffer))
      (delay-mode-hooks
	(unless (eq major-mode 'tui-term-mode)
	  (tui-term-mode))
	(pop-to-buffer (current-buffer)
		       '((display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
			 (pop-up-frame-parameters
			  (auto-hide-function . delete-frame))))
	(let (term-exec-hook)
	  (term-exec (current-buffer) name "sh" nil
		     (list "-c" command)))
